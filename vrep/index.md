Martys can be simulated using *Coppelia Robotics'* popular **V-REP** simulator. The simulator exposes
a standard V-REP API for controlling the simulated robots, but you can also integrate it with **ROS**
to use the same control software as you would an advanced real-Marty setup, and be able to quickly
toggle between the two.
